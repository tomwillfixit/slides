!!center
<red>C<green>o<yellow>l<blue>o<purple>r<end>

slide.sh supports a number of color options:
!!nocenter
    <red>red<end>
    <green>green<end>
    <blue>blue<end>
    <cyan>cyan<end>
    <yellow>yellow<end>
    <purple>purple<end>

!!center
!!nocolor
You can use !!nocolor to disable colors, and !!color to re-enable it later.

Colors are invoked using "<colorname>". So for example, <red> would give you red
text until the next <colorname> or <end> is encountered.
